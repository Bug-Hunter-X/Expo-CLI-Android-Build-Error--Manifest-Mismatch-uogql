While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the Expo CLI and the interaction with a third-party library.  The error message was quite vague, mentioning a 'manifest mismatch' but not providing specific details on which manifest or the exact nature of the mismatch. The error only appeared when I tried to run the app on an Android device, it worked fine on iOS simulator, but the application wouldn't start, and the error log was unhelpful. The project used several libraries, including react-native-maps and react-native-vector-icons, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact source of the conflict. I tried clearing the cache, reinstalling node modules, and even creating a new project, but the issue persisted.
