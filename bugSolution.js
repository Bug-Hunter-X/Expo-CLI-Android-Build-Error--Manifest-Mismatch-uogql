The issue was tracked down to a conflict in the AndroidManifest.xml related to the react-native-maps library.  The solution involved explicitly setting the `android:exported` attribute to `true` for the activities and services used by react-native-maps within the AndroidManifest.xml file.  This ensures compatibility with other Android components and resolves the manifest mismatch.

This modification forces the activities and services to be explicitly declared as exportable, thereby resolving the conflict during the build process. If other libraries cause manifest errors, a similar approach can be used by carefully inspecting the Manifest to ensure no conflicting configurations exist.
